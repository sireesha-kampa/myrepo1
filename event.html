     First, let's learn a little more about our fictional company, Universal Containers.
     Universal Containers is a rapidly growing international supplier of container products. The company
     produces every kind of container from simple overnight letter mailers to custom equipment packaging
     to large cargo shipping containers. In addition, Universal Containers develops and maintains its own
     proprietary software to facilitate the design of its various types of containers. As such, Universal Containers
     has a very diverse group of employees, including facilities and operations professionals, software and
     design engineers, financial accountants, and legal and human resources personnel.
     Historically, the Human Resources department has used Microsoft Word documents and Microsoft Excel
     spreadsheets to manage the recruiting and hiring process for new employees. However, over the last two
     quarters it's become evident that unless this process is replaced by one that is more collaborative, reliable,
     and scalable, the department won't be able to meet its hiring goals for this fiscal year. Universal Containers
     needs a centralized application that can bring all of its recruiting and hiring processes together, and the
     company has hired us to solve this problem. Our approach will be to leverage their Salesforce account
     and build a recruiting application on the Force.com platform. We're going to introduce Universal Containers
     to the world of cloud computing!
     Considerations for the Recruiting App
     After meeting with Megan Smith, Universal Containers' vice president of Human Resources, we've drawn
     up a few requirements for the new Recruiting app. The app needs to:
     • Track positions in all stages of the process, from those that are open to those that have been filled or
     canceled.
     • Track all of the candidates who apply for a particular position, including the status of their application
     (whether they've had a phone screen, are scheduled for interviews, have been rejected or hired, or
     have passed on an offer that was presented).
     • Track the posting of jobs on external employment websites, such as Monster.com.
     • Allow employees to post reviews for candidates whom they've interviewed.
     • Provide security for the recruiting data so that it's not mistakenly viewed, edited, or deleted by
     employees who shouldn't have access.
     • Automatically inform the relevant recruiter about the next steps that should be taken when a decision
     has been made about an applicant.
     • Automatically inform all employees of new positions that have been posted.
     • Make sure that a new job opening has executive approval before it becomes active.

     • Include reports that give users an overview of recruiting status.
     • Allow recruiters to map the locations of all candidates who are applying for a position, to better
     understand relocation expenses.
     • Make it easy to perform several similar tasks at once, like rejecting multiple job applications.
     • Automatically post open positions on Universal Containers' public website.
     An app that meets these requirements is going to greatly increase the efficiency of Universal Containers'
     recruiting and hiring processes.
     Building the App: Our Design
     Let's take a look at the different parts of the Force.com platform that we'll use to implement Universal
     Containers' Recruiting app. We'll learn about all of these things in a lot more detail in later chapters, but
     for now, this quick preview will give you an idea about what's in store.
     Custom Objects
     Custom objects are the native components that model the data we need to store in our Recruiting app.
     Similar to a database table, a custom object is composed of several fields that store information such as a
     job applicant's name, or the maximum salary for a particular position. However, unlike traditional database
     tables, we don't need to write any SQL in order to create custom objects. We can simply point and click
     in the platform to create as many objects as we need.
     For our Recruiting app, we'll be creating six custom objects to track recruiting-related data:
     • Position
     • Candidate
     • Job Application
     • Review
     • Job Posting
     • Employment Website
     Most of these objects will be displayed as tabs in our application and menu items in Salesforce1. When a
     user clicks one of the tabs, he or she will have acc
